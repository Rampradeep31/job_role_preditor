# 🎯 Edu2Job – AI-Based Job Role Predictor

## 📌 Project Overview
Edu2Job is a web-based **machine learning application** that predicts suitable job roles
based on a user’s **education, skills, and profile details**.

The project helps **students and fresh graduates** make informed career decisions by
providing **AI-driven job role recommendations** aligned with their qualifications.
It was developed as part of an **internship program** and focuses on real-world
**ML integration with a full-stack web application**.

## 🚀 Need for the Project
Many students face challenges in choosing the right career path due to:
- Lack of personalized career guidance  
- Skill-to-job mismatch  
- Limited awareness of suitable job roles  
- Manual and non-data-driven counseling  

Edu2Job solves this by using **machine learning** to analyze user profiles and recommend
**relevant job roles automatically**.

## ⚙️ How the Project Works
1. Users enter their educational and skill details through the web interface  
2. The backend processes and preprocesses the input data  
3. Encoders and scalers transform the data into a machine-readable format  
4. A trained ML model predicts the most suitable job role  
5. The predicted job role is displayed on the dashboard
